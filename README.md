# Brick-Plus
This is a simple chrome extension developed by me (Hurricane), and it will be updated with more features (Once I figure out the API ports for Brick Planet) have fun! Don't forget to credit me and this project if you SHARE IT TO YOUTUBE OR ANYTHING ELSE! Profile: https://www.brickplanet.com/profile/8834/hurricane

# Instillation
This is quite the simple instilation, just like any other chrome extension (that's not uploaded to the store)

1) Download this code as a ZIP, then extract it to a folder.
2) Go to edge://extensions/ or chrome://extensions/
3) Turn on Developer Mode
4) Load unpacked, and select the folder you extracted

Done!

# Updates
V 1.0.0 - Shop conversion to USD (To CAD, EUROS and more coming soon)
